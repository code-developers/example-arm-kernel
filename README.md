A simple kernel made for supporting arm devices


Characteristics of arm-kernel Microkernel
=================================

* arm-kernel follows the fundamental principles of microkernels in that it implements
  address spaces, thread management, and IPC only in the privileged kernel.

* Designed and customized for ARM Cortex-M, supporting NVIC (Nested Vectored
  Interrupt Controller), Bit Banding, MPU (Memory Protection Unit).

* Energy efficient scheduling and tickless timer which allow the ARM Cortex-M
  to wake up only when needed, either at a scheduled time or on an interrupt
  event. Therefore, it results in better current consumption than the common
  approach using the system timer, SysTick, which requires a constantly
  running and high frequency clock.

* KProbes, dynamic instrumentation system inspired by Linux Kernel, allowing
  developers to gather additional information about kernel operation without
  recompiling or rebooting the kernel. It enables locations in the kernel to
  be instrumented with code, and the instrumentation code runs when the ARM
  core encounters that probe point. Once the instrumentation code completes
  execution, the kernel continues normal execution.

* Each thread has its own TCB (Thread Control Block) and addressed by its
  global id. Also dispatcher is responsible for switching contexts. Threads
  with the same priority are executed in a round-robin fashion.

* Memory management is split into three concepts:
  - Memory pool, which represent area of physical address space with specific
    attributes.
  - Flexible page, which describes an always size aligned region of an address
    space. Unlike other L4 implementations, flexible pages in arm-kernel represent MPU
    region instead.
  - Address space, which is made up of these flexible pages.

* System calls are provided to manage address spaces:
  - Grant: The memory page is granted to a new user and cannot be used anymore
    by its former user.
  - Map: This implements shared memory â€“ the memory page is passed to another
    task but can be used by both tasks.
  - Flush: The memory page that has been mapped to other users will be flushed
    out of their address space.

* Regarding the interaction between a user thread and the microkernel, the
  concept of UTCB (user-level thread-control blocks) is being taken on. A UTCB
  is a small thread-specific region in the thread's virtual address space,
  which is always mapped. Therefore, the access to the UTCB can never raise a
  page fault, which makes it perfect for the kernel to access system-call
  arguments, in particular IPC payload copied from/to user threads.

* The kernel provides synchronous IPC (inter-process communication), for which
  short IPC carries payload in CPU registers only and full IPC copies message
  payload via the UTCBs of the communicating parties.

* Debugging and profiling mechanisms:
  - configurable debug console
  - memory dump
  - thread profiling: name, uptime, stack allocated/current/used
  - memory profiling: kernel table, pool free/allocated size, fragmentation
